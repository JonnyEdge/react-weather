# React Weather App

Straightforward (and rough around the edges) React weather app.

## Technologies Used

* React
* JSX
* Enzyme

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start up the application:

```bash
npm start
```

### Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

You should see a text input field, and a lone comma in the H1. Search for a British city, and the weather forecast should update.
